# Recolorize examples

A repository with example files and code illustrating how to use the `recolorize` package (https://github.com/hiweller/recolorize). Before running these examples, I recommend installing the development version of the package:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hiweller/recolorize")
```

Alternatively, you can install the release version of the package from CRAN (just know that this will lag behind the development version):

```{r}
install.packages("recolorize")
```
