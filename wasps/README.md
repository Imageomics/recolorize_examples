# Recolorize examples

Code and images for running examples of the `recolorize` R package (https://github.com/hiweller/recolorize). To run these examples, I recommend installing the development version of `recolorize`:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hiweller/recolorize")
```

You can also install the CRAN release (which will not be the most up-to-date, but should still run most if not all examples):

```{r}
install.packages("recolorize")
```
